# Calliope
üìú Language clarity model for [Ariadne](https://github.com/wsg-ariadne/ariadne).

Calliope is a Naive-Bayes classifier that is meant to process the text from a cookie banner and classify it into the following classes:

1. `GOOD` indicating that the language used in the extract is likely to be clear, descriptive, and provides options to provide or deny cookie consent
2. `BAD` indicating that the language used in the extract is likely to be confusing, vague, and assuming that cookie consent will be provided

This classifier allows [Ariadne](https://github.com/wsg-ariadne/ariadne) to determine whether a website uses deceptive design in the form of unclear language on its cookie banner.

## Usage

### Requirements
Install Python 3.8+ (tested on 3.8.16) and the packages in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Generating the model
Run `python generate.py` to generate the model, save the model as a pickle, and test the pickled model.

### Using the model
Run `python test.py` to have the program provide an opportunity to input text and provide more explicit output regarding the result.

## Details on the Model
### Dataset
The dataset used to train this model includes photos selected from the Soe, Norberg, Guribye, and Slakovik made available [here](https://github.com/videoworkflow/cookiepopup). The transcription through OCR, classification, and labeling applied for this project were done by the developers of [**ariadne**](https://github.com/wsg-ariadne).

    abstract = { To ensure that users of online services understand what data are collected and how they are used in algorithmic decision-making, the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) specifies informed consent as a minimal requirement. For online news outlets consent is commonly elicited through interface design elements in the form of a pop-up. We have manually analyzed 300 data collection consent notices from news outlets that are built to ensure compliance with GDPR. The analysis uncovered a variety of strategies or dark patterns that circumvent the intent of GDPR by design. We further study the presence and variety of these dark patterns in these ‚Äúcookie consents‚Äù and use our observations to specify the concept of dark pattern in the context of consent elicitation.},
