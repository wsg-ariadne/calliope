# Calliope
ðŸ“œ Language clarity model for [Ariadne](https://github.com/wsg-ariadne/ariadne).

Janus is a Naive-Bayes classifier that is meant to process the text from a cookie banner and classify it into the following classes:

1. `GOOD` indicating that the language used in the extract is likely to be clear, descriptive, and provides options to provide or deny cookie consent
2. `BAD` indicating that the language used in the extract is likely to be confusing, vague, and assuming that cookie consent will be provided

This classifier allows [Ariadne](https://github.com/wsg-ariadne/ariadne) to determine whether a website uses deceptive design in the form of unclear language on its cookie banner.
